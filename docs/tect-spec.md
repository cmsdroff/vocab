# UN/CEFACT JSON-LD Web Vocabulary - Technical Specification

## Abstract
UN/CEFACT's vocabulary, supporting modern technology

## Introduction

### Background
Informal draft work 2018-2021.  

### Web semantics 
A high level introduction to web semantics and JSON-LD. 

## Methodology
How is this standard produced.

## Architecture
UN/CEFACT vocabulary in a broader context. What does the world need from UN? What does UN/CEFACT need from the world? 

## Requirements
What are 

## Scope
This project will deliver a high quality JSON-LD vocabulary published to a well-known unece domain and maintained throughout the ongoing development of the CCL, RDMs, and code lists. The vocabulary will be both human readable and machine readable and will support the international community in the development of interoperable APIs, IoT streams, and Verifiable Credentials. 

In order to support that outcome, the project will deliver
* A technical specification that describes the JSON-LD structure and architecture. This work is already 90% completed as a technical guidance note from the RDM2API project – please refer to “draft-rdm2api-json-ld-ndr-docx at https://uncefact.unece.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=43384856
* A human and machine readable JSON-LD vocabulary on a unece web domain. This works is already 90% completed and a draft vocabulary is available at https://service.unece.org/trade/uncefact/vocabulary/uncefact/ (human readable) and https://service.unece.org/trade/uncefact/vocabulary/uncefact.jsonld (machine readable)
* A publishing mechanism that allows the secretariat to continue to easily update the vocabulary as CCL, RDM, and code list changes happen.

It has been agreed that the scope will NOT cover 
* API and Schemas
* Data Modelling work as we are re-using existing work rather than creating new standards or subsets of existing.

## Deliverables 

1. A PDF / Word document which covers the project lifecycle including; Public Review logs and Final document ready for official publication.
2. Code in the UN/CEFACT GitHub to deliver the published & maintained JSON-LD vocabulary

## Maintenance
Release Cycles and practicalities.
